*** General advice about alt attributes

alt attributes should be descriptive for important images, like this body surfer. Because body surfing is important, I guess.

alt attributes should be empty for images that are just decorations, like this boiler image. Do you get the joke? It's a boiler to represent boiler plate code, which is sometimes empty of content.

alt attributes should be set on every image, just like this pig is set on being so darn cute.
